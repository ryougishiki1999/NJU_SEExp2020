  @brief
  Call given derived table processor (preparing or filling tables)

  @param lex        LEX for this thread
  @param processor  procedure of derived table processing

  @details
  This function runs all derived tables present in the query through specified
  'phases' and used for preparing derived tables and instantiating result
  tables. The provided processor is called on all derived tables without
  exceptions. This differs from the TABLE_LIST::handle_derived where
  derived tables of different type are handled separately. Because of this
  SELECT_LEX::handle_derived can't be used here (it employs
  TABLE_LIST::handle_derived).
  Derived tables processing doesn't run in hierarchical order thus this
  function is suitable mostly for prepare and create stages as they don't
  depend on whether underlying derived tables were prepared or created already.
  This function uses SELECT_LEX::table_list/TABLE_LIST::next_local chain as
  the list of tables.

  @see TABLE_LIST::handle_derived.

  @brief Create temporary table structure (but do not fill it).

  @param thd Thread handle
  @param lex LEX for this thread
  @param derived TABLE_LIST of the derived table in the upper SELECT

  @details 

  This function is called before any command containing derived tables is
  executed. Currently the function is used for derived tables, i.e.

  - Anonymous derived tables, or 
  - Named derived tables (aka views) with the @c TEMPTABLE algorithm.
   
  The table reference, contained in @c derived, is updated with the
  fields of a new temporary table.

  Derived tables are stored in @c thd-&gt;derived_tables and closed by
  close_thread_tables().

  This function is part of the procedure that starts in
  open_and_lock_tables(), a procedure that - among other things - introduces
  new table and table reference objects (to represent derived tables) that
  don't exist in the privilege database. This means that normal privilege
  checking cannot handle them. Hence this function does some extra tricks in
  order to bypass normal privilege checking, by exploiting the fact that the
  current state of privilege verification is attached as GRANT_INFO structures
  on the relevant TABLE and TABLE_REF objects.

  For table references, the current state of accrued access is stored inside
  TABLE_LIST::grant. Hence this function must update the state of fulfilled
  privileges for the new TABLE_LIST, an operation which is normally performed
  exclusively by the table and database access checking functions,
  check_access() and check_grant(), respectively. This modification is done
  for both views and anonymous derived tables: The @c SELECT privilege is set
  as fulfilled by the user. However, if a view is referenced and the table
  reference is queried against directly (see TABLE_LIST::referencing_view),
  the state of privilege checking (GRANT_INFO struct) is copied as-is to the
  temporary table.

  This function implements a signature called "derived table processor", and
  is passed as a function pointer to mysql_handle_derived().

  @note This function sets @c SELECT_ACL for @c TEMPTABLE views as well as
  anonymous derived tables, but this is ok since later access checking will
  distinguish between them.

  @see mysql_handle_derived(), mysql_derived_filling(), GRANT_INFO
