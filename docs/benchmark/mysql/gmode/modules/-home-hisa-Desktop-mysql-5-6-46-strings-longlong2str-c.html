/*
  Defines: longlong2str();

  longlong2str(dst, radix, val)
  converts the (longlong) integer "val" to character form and moves it to
  the destination string "dst" followed by a terminating NUL.  The
  result is normally a pointer to this NUL character, but if the radix
  is dud the result will be NullS and nothing will be changed.

  If radix is -2..-36, val is taken to be SIGNED.
  If radix is  2.. 36, val is taken to be UNSIGNED.
  That is, val is signed if and only if radix is.  You will normally
  use radix -10 only through itoa and ltoa, for radix 2, 8, or 16
  unsigned is what you generally want.

  _dig_vec is public just in case someone has a use for it.
  The definitions of itoa and ltoa are actually macros in m_string.h,
  but this is where the code is.

  Note: The standard itoa() returns a pointer to the argument, when int2str
	returns the pointer to the end-null.
	itoa assumes that 10 -base numbers are allways signed and other arn't.
