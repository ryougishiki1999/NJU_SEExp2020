  Convert a string to an to unsigned long long integer value
  
  SYNOPSYS
    my_strtoll10()
      nptr     in       pointer to the string to be converted
      endptr   in/out   pointer to the end of the string/
                        pointer to the stop character
      error    out      returned error code
 
  DESCRIPTION
    This function takes the decimal representation of integer number
    from string nptr and converts it to an signed or unsigned
    long long integer value.
    Space characters and tab are ignored.
    A sign character might precede the digit characters. The number
    may have any number of pre-zero digits.

    The function stops reading the string nptr at the first character
    that is not a decimal digit. If endptr is not NULL then the function
    will not read characters after *endptr.
 
  RETURN VALUES
    Value of string as a signed/unsigned longlong integer

    if no error and endptr != NULL, it will be set to point at the character
    after the number

    The error parameter contains information how things went:
    -1		Number was an ok negative number
    0	 	ok
    ERANGE	If the the value of the converted number exceeded the
	        maximum negative/unsigned long long integer.
		In this case the return value is ~0 if value was
		positive and LONGLONG_MIN if value was negative.
    EDOM	If the string didn't contain any digits. In this case
    		the return value is 0.

    If endptr is not NULL the function will store the end pointer to
    the stop character here.
