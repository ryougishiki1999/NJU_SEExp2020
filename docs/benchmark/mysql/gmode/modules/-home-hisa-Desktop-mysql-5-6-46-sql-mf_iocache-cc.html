/**
  @file

  @details
  Caching of files with only does (sequential) read or writes of fixed-
  length records. A read isn't allowed to go over file-length. A read is ok
  if it ends at file-length and next read can try to read after file-length
  (and get a EOF-error).
  Possibly use of asyncronic io.
  macros for read and writes for faster io.
  Used instead of FILE when reading or writing whole files.
  This will make mf_rec_cache obsolete.
  One can change info-&gt;pos_in_file to a higher value to skip bytes in file if
  also info-&gt;rc_pos is set to info-&gt;rc_end.
  If called through open_cached_file(), then the temporary file will
  only be created if a write exeeds the file buffer or if one calls
  flush_io_cache().
