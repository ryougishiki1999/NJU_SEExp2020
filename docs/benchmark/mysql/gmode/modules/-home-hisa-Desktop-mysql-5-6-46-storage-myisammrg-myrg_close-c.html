    children must be closed and info-&gt;rec_per_key_part is part of the
    'info' multi_alloc.
    If info-&gt;children_attached is false, this is called from a MySQL
    server. Children are closed independently but info-&gt;rec_per_key_part
    must be freed.
    Just in case of a server panic (myrg_panic()) info-&gt;children_attached
    might be true. We would close the children though they should be
    closed independently and info-&gt;rec_per_key_part is not freed.
    This should be acceptable for a panic.
    In case of a MySQL server and no children, children_attached is
    always true. In this case no rec_per_key_part has been allocated.
    So it is correct to use the branch where an empty list of tables is
    (not) closed.
