  Using SAFE_MUTEX is impossible, because of recursion.
  - code locks mutex X
    - P_S records the event
      - P_S needs an atomic counter A
        - safe mutex called for m_mutex[hash(A)]
          - safe mutex allocates/free memory
            - safe mutex locks THR_LOCK_malloc
              - P_S records the event
                - P_S needs an atomic counter B
                  - safe mutex called for m_mutex[hash(B)]

  When hash(A) == hash(B), safe_mutex complains rightly that
  the mutex is already locked.
  In some cases, A == B, in particular for events_waits_history_long_index.

  In short, the implementation of PFS_atomic should not cause events
  to be recorded in the performance schema.

  Also, because SAFE_MUTEX redefines pthread_mutex_t, etc,
  this code is not inlined in pfs_atomic.h, but located here in pfs_atomic.cc.

  What is needed is a plain, unmodified, pthread_mutex_t.
  This is provided by my_atomic_rwlock_t.

  Using a rwlock per performance schema structure would be too costly in

  The PFS_atomic implementation computes a hash value from the
  atomic variable, to spread the bottleneck across 256 buckets,
  while still providing --transparently for the caller-- an atomic
