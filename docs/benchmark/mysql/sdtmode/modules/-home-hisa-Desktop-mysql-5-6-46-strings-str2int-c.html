/*
  str2int(src, radix, lower, upper, &amp;val)
  converts the string pointed to by src to an integer and stores it in
  val.	It skips leading spaces and tabs (but not newlines, formfeeds,
  backspaces), then it accepts an optional sign and a sequence of digits
  in the specified radix.  The result should satisfy lower &lt;= *val &lt;= upper.
  The result is a pointer to the first character after the number;
  trailing spaces will NOT be skipped.

  If an error is detected, the result will be NullS, the value put
  in val will be 0, and errno will be set to
	EDOM	if there are no digits
	ERANGE	if the result would overflow or otherwise fail to lie
		within the specified bounds.
  Check that the bounds are right for your machine.
  This looks amazingly complicated for what you probably thought was an
  easy task.  Coping with integer overflow and the asymmetric range of
  twos complement machines is anything but easy.

  So that users of atoi and atol can check whether an error occured,
  I have taken a wholly unprecedented step: errno is CLEARED if this
  call has no problems.
