Initialize lock queue iterator so that it starts to iterate from
"lock". bit_no specifies the record number within the heap where the
record is stored. It can be undefined (ULINT_UNDEFINED) in two cases:
1. If the lock is a table lock, thus we have a table lock queue;
2. If the lock is a record lock and it is a wait lock. In this case
   bit_no is calculated in this function by using
   lock_rec_find_set_bit(). There is exactly one bit set in the bitmap
   of a wait lock. */
